# Archbishop Mitty High School Open House

We are pleased to open our doors to prospective students and their families for our annual Open House.  This year's event will take place on 
Sunday, November 24, 2024 from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.  Student led tours, informational presentations, and faculty staffed booths are 
available throughout the day.  Please make plans to join us to see campus, chat with our administration, faculty, staff, parents and students 
and get a sense of all that the Archbishop Mitty Catholic college preparatory education has to offer. 

Families should allow approximately 90 minutes for their Open House visit.  To register for the event please create a Ravenna account.
